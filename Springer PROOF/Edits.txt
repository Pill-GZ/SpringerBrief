page 7, line 8: Replace, "And finally Sect." by "Section "
page 14, line 22: Replace "diverge." by "diverges."
page 14, line 230: Add ":" after "exists"
page 16, line 292: Please replace "that" by "those".
page 16, line 314: Please re-format the reference to "(Donoho and Jin 2004)"
page 18, line 363: Change "risk to fo to" to "risk to go to".
page 19, line 382: Please add the words "is the generalized inverse of F." at the end of that sentence as indicated in the annotation.
page 19, line 387: Add "the", i.e., "By the definition"
page viii, line 49: Change "type thresholding" to "types of thresholding".

* Page 31, line 154: Delete "at", i.e. should be "...high power for all sparsity levels."

* Page 31, line 182: Delete "and", i.e., should be "Although ... in multiple testing problems, such procedures..."  NOTE:  Did you mean here: "Although ... in multiple testing and support recovery problems, such procedures ..."

* Page 32, Caption of Fig. 3.2: Add a period, i.e., ".", at the end of the last sentence. 
* Page 34, line 250: Add "the" before "approximate", i.e., should be "... phase transition of the approximate ...".
* Page 34, line 259: Replace "that in" by "those in the proof of".
* Page 34, line 261: An extra "(" in the third normal distribution, i.e., it should be "N(\overline{\Delta},1)".
* Page 36, line 292: Delete "with", i.e., it should be "using (3.27)...".  Side note:  Maybe this is obvious to you but it took me some time to show that if X(i)<^d Y(i), where the pairs X(i)'s are independent and Y(i)'s are independent, then X(1)+...+X(n) <^d Y(1)+...+Y(n).
The way I argued has by placing the pair (X(i),Y(i)) in the same probability space so that X(i)<= Y(i) almost surely.  Then, the claim follows...

* Page 38, line 342: Add "the" before "definition".
* Page 38, line 345: Add "the" before "power".


* Page 39, line 367: We have "\hat G(x_{[i]}) = i/p" almost surely, only if we have continuous CDFs.  If we have ties among the order statistics, the above equality is formally not true.  MAYBE: we can sneakily add: (1) the assumption that F0 is continuous (which we also use); (2) add "a.s. (by since by continuity there are no ties in the order statistics, with probability one)" or the shorter "a.s. (by continuity of the alternatives)". 
* Page 38, line 350: Add "continuous" after "common".  NOTE: This is in an attempt to resolve the issue with the order statistics above. 

* page 41, line 418: Add "the" before "exact-approximate".
* page 41, line 434 (This is one LONG line.  The subscript "p" is missing in the definition of "t^*", so it is best that we drop it throughout to avoid confusion OR IDEALLY write 

 "we know that $t_p < t_p^* \equiv t^*$ for large p." 

This is a MINOR point and we can SKIP it.

* page 42, line 441: Add "the" before "relative stability".
* page 42, line 459: Delete "slightly" (if YOU THINK it is OK). I think the two problems ARE different so "slightly" is not needed.
* page 43, line 468: Add "the" before "approximate".
* page 45, line 533: Replace "increases" by "increase".

CHAPTER 4

 * page 48, line 43: Add "the" before "Hamming".
 * page 53, line 194: Add "a" before "simple", I.e., " a simple ...".
 * page 54, line 221: Add "the" before "null".
 * page 56, line 267 & 272: Add "the" before "signals".
 * page 57, line 283: Delete "in the main text", I.e., it should be "... converges to 1, as in (4.27), whereas ..."
 * page 57, line 290: Replace "apply" by "applies".
 * page 57, line 292: Add "been" after "have", i.e., it should be "...have been left out...".
 * page 58, line 317: Replace "the class URS" by "the URS", I.e., delete the first occurrence of the word "class" on this line.
 * page 58, line 316: Add "partially" before "characterize", i.e., the full sentence should be "We will partially characterize the URS dependence class in Chap. 6."
 * page 58 & 59: OPTIONAL: Ideally, we should clarify the statement of Theorem 4.3 as follows:
    (a) Delete "\hat S=" on line 330
    (b) Replace "\hat S_p" by "\hat S_p^{\rm Bonf}" in (4.34), line 333.
   This way, the reader will not confuse "\hat S_p" with "\hat S_p^{\rm Bonf}".
 
 * page 59, line 340:  A SMALL CORRECTION TO THE PROOF: Sorry, I introduced the slowly varying function "\ell" and created a small discrepancy:
  
    In LINE 2 of the "Proof", replace "... by replacing [p^{1-\beta}] with [cp]" with "... by replacing \ell(p)p^{1-\beta} with [cp]".

 * page 60, Fig. 4.1: Caption: Please add a "." (Period) at the end of the last sentence in the caption of this figure.
