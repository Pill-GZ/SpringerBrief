We establish in this section minimax versions of our results from Section \ref{sec:boundary}.
Specifically, if we restrict ourselves to \emph{the class of thresholding procedures} $\cal T$ (defined in \eqref{eq:thresholding-procedure}), then Bonferroni's procedure is minimax optimal, for \emph{any} fixed dependence structures in the URS class.
This is formalized in Corollary \ref{cor:point-wise-minimax} in Section \ref{subsec:point-wise-minimax}.
We refer to this result as \emph{point-wise} minimax, to emphasize the fact that this optimality holds for every \emph{fixed} URS array.

Meanwhile, if we search over \emph{all procedures}, but expand the space of models to include {\em all} dependence structures, then a different minimax optimality statement holds for Bonferroni's procedure.
This result, formally stated in Section \ref{subsec:minimax-over-dependence}, is a consequence of our characterization of the finite-sample Bayes optimality of thresholding procedures in Sections \ref{subsec:Bayes-optimality} and \ref{subsec:optimal-procedure-sub-exponential}.
% The result is of independent interest and it is the main contribution of this section.

Finally, we offer some insights into the support recovery problem in the case when errors have heavier-than-exponential tails in Section \ref{subsec:optimal-procedure-super-exponential}.
